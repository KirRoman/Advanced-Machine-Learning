    "1. Чтобы в этой подзадаче мы могли сохранить воспроизводимость результатов, вам потребуется вначале создать объект генератора кросс-валидации StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n, shuffle=True, random_state=21), где значение n вам нужно будет оптимизировать. Подробности ниже.\n",
    "2. Объедините три модели, которые вы обучили ранее, в один StackingClassifier. Посчитайте accuracy, precision, recall на валидационной выборке. Попробуйте разные значения n_splits [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] в генераторе кроссвалидации и разные значения параметра passthrough в самом StackingClassifier.\n",
    "3. Посчитайте accuracy, precision и recall для тестовой выборки для того StackingClassifier, у которого наилучшие веса с точки зрения accuracy на валидационной выборке (если несколько моделей имеют одинаковое accuracy, то выберите ту, у которой более высокий precision). Используйте final_estimator=LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')."
